# Virtual-Mouse-using-Hand-Gestures
A Python-based virtual mouse that uses a webcam and hand gestures to control the cursor and perform clicks. Built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, it tracks your hand in real time to move the pointer, click, and drag using specific finger positions.  Note: This project is still in progress : accuracy may vary, and improvements are welcome.

# Features
Move the mouse pointer using the index finger tip
Click by raising both index and middle fingers
Drag-and-drop using pinch gesture (thumb and index finger close together)
Works in real time with a standard webcam

Note: This project is still under development. The tracking and gestures may not always be correct or accurate. Feel free to improve or modify the code for better performance.
