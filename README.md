# Virtual-Mouse-using-Hand-Gestures
A Python-based virtual mouse that uses a webcam and hand gestures to control the cursor and perform clicks. Built with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, it tracks your hand in real time to move the pointer, click, and drag using specific finger positions.  Note: This project is still in progress : accuracy may vary, and improvements are welcome.
